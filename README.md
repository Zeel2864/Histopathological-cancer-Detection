# Histopathological cancer Detection
    Domain      : Computer Vision, Machine Learning
    Sub-Domain  : Deep Learning, Image Recognition, Transfer Learning
    Techniques  : Deep Convolutional Neural Network, resnet101
    Application : Image Classification, Medical Imaging

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that will identify the metastatic tissues in histopathologic scans of the lymph node sections using one of the deep learning 
techniques. We aim to classify cancer tissues based on the labels - Malignant or Benign. For simplicity, we have given Malignant as “1” and Benign as “0”. 


## Description

In this dataset, we are provided with many small pathology images to classify. Files are named with an image id. The trains_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. We are predicting the labels for the images in the test folder. A positive label indicates that the centre 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumour tissue.
